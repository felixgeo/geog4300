ChatGPT can write R code! Let's try it out.

First, we'll load some existing data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

census_cty<-st_read("data/ACSCtyData_2019ACS_simplify.gpkg")
cpsdata<-read_csv("data/IPUMS_CPS_FoodSec.csv")
```

For your first task, ask ChatGPT to map out the poverty rate variable (`pov_pop_pct`) using tmap. You can also add it to add elements like a north arrow and scale bar.

```{r}
#Code goes here.
```

For your third task, ask ChatGPT to test the normality of the EARNWEEK variable, filtering out any responses over 5000. Then ask it to create a qqplot for that variable.

```{r}
#Code goes here.
```


For your third task, ask ChatGPT to write code changes FSSTATUS_cat to a dummy variable (0=food secure, 0=food insecure) and then calculates a confidence interval for the rate of food insecurity nationally.

```{r}
#Code goes here.
```
